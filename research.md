## Gamma Ray Source Localization
<p align="justify">
Based largely on subtle differences in solid angle and array self-occlusion, a point-like gamma ray source will give an approximately unique distribution of counts across an array of stationary detectors. By analyzing these subtle differences, a source can then theoretically be localized. In non-trivial environments, sources of scatter, attenuation, varying background radiation, and other sources of noise can greatly complicate the localization process. This project focuses on using various machine learning algorithms and techniques to improve overall localization capabilities. One algorithmic approach in recent literature involves comparisons to prepopulated reference tables. Preliminary results indicate that machine learning can better capture the relationship between the detector array response and gamma ray source location. These methods have the potential to be applied to various nuclear and homeland security applications, including urban radiation source search and cargo screenings.
