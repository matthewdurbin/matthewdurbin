Hello! My name is Matthew Durbin, and I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://www.nuce.psu.edu/">Ken and Mary Alice Lindquist Department of Nuclear Engineering</a> at Penn State University. I work in Professor Azaree Lintereur’s radiation detection and measurement group where I am supported by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission Graduate Fellowship and expect to graduate in May of 2022. I am also a <a href="https://seaborg.llnl.gov/">Glenn T. Seaborg Institute</a> 2021 summer intern at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 

I research radiation detection applications for homeland security and nuclear safeguards and try to leverage machine learning in that domain space. Over the years, I have worked with many different types of detectors and read-out systems and have used various machine learning models and techniques to extract information from the data those systems produce. I hope to continue working on radiation detection system and algorithm development upon completion of my PhD.

I am originally from Texas and obtained a BS in Physics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2017. Outside of my research, I am heavily involved with the <a href="https://www.inmm.org/">Institute of Nuclear Materials Management</a> and am a previous President of Penn State’s Student Chapter. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, traveling, hiking, and bread making.
