Hello! My name is Matthew Duribn, and I am a PhD Candidate at the [Ken and Mary Alice Lindquist Department of Nuclear Engineering](https://www.nuce.psu.edu/) at Penn State University and I am advised by Professor Azaree Lintereur. I research radiation detection applications to nuclear safeguards and security, and try to incoperate machine learning into that domain space! I obtained a BS in Physics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2017, and aim to gradaute with my PhD in 2022.
