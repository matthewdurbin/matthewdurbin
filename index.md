Hello! My name is Matthew Duribn, and I am a PhD Candidate at the [Ken and Mary Alice Lindquist Department of Nuclear Engineering](https://www.nuce.psu.edu/) at Penn State University. I research radiation detection applications to nuclear safeguards and security, and try to incoperate machine learning into that domain space! I obtained a BS in Physics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2017, and aim to gradaute with my PhD in 2022. 


You can find [my CV here](MDurbin_CV.pdf) and contact me at <mdurbin@psu.edu>. 


### RadSI - The Radiation Source Inventory
I recently developed a simple CLI application that allows you to keep track of the activity of various radioactive sources in you "inventory". [The project's repo is here!](https://github.com/matthewdurbin/RadSI)
