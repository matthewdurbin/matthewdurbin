Hello! My name is Matthew Duribn, and I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://www.nuce.psu.edu/">Ken and Mary Alice Lindquist Department of Nuclear Engineering</a> at Penn State University. I research radiation detection applications to nuclear safeguards and security, and try to incoperate machine learning into that domain space! I am supported by a Nuclear Regulatory Commision Graduate Fellowship and am advised by Professor Azaree Lintereur. I obtained a BS in Physics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2017, and aim to gradaute with my PhD in 2022.
