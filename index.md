Hello! My name is Matthew Durbin, and I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://www.nuce.psu.edu/">Ken and Mary Alice Lindquist Department of Nuclear Engineering</a> at Penn State University. I work in Professor Azaree Lintereur’s radiation detection and measurement group where I am supported by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission Graduate Fellowship and expect to graduate in May of 2022.

I research radiation detection applications for homeland security and nuclear safeguards and try to leverage machine learning in that domain space.  I believe incorporation of machine learning to the radiation detection field will only occur by those knowledgeable of not only the inner workings of machine learning, but those who also have a solid grasp of radiation instrumentation and the unique data that it produces. I hope to be one of those people! Much of my graduate school efforts have been dedicated to gaining knowledge and skills in these areas. Over the years, I have worked with many different types of detectors and read-out systems and have used various machine learning models and techniques to extract information from the data those systems produce. 

I am originally from Texas and obtained a BS in Physics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2017. Outside of my research, I am heavily involved with the <a href="https://www.inmm.org/">Institute of Nuclear Materials Management</a> and currently serve as the President of Penn State’s Student Chapter. I enjoy fun programing projects such as developing CLIs,  making silly bots that interact with APIs, and playing with ARDUINOs. I also enjoy reading, traveling, and working with Flour, Water, Salt, and Yeast.
